Do Not Disturb Notify app

This is the mobile app which show your status as soon as you receive a call

I got instruction that app should show toat while it in active state, that feature is Working
but apart from that i have also attached it with a service , So now even if App is killed it will show
a Toast message as call received.

/****** HOW TO BUILD AND RUN THE APP *******/
first of all download the code or i will share the apk with you
install the apk
it will ask for permission , allow that
make sure your phone allow notification from service of an unknown app, if it will not allow then you have to manually allow that
thats it, Now set status message and choose toggle ON/OFF for status message
if status toggle is ON and message is Set , then you will receive TOAST MSG as soon as you receive call
